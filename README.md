gitbucket-gitlab-migration
==========================

This is a tool containing some wrapped library code that allows you to migrate pieces from a Gitbucket server to a Gitlab server.

This is far from a full migrator, it will only relocate some sections via the API's, such as issues. This code is freely available if anyone else wants to expand upon existing validated work.
